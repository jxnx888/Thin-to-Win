            <P> Running may be the single most effective exercise to increase life expectancy, according to a new review and analysis of past research about exercise and premature death. The new study found that, compared to nonrunners, runners tended to live about three additional years, even if they run slowly or sporadically and smoke, drink or are overweight. No other form of exercise that researchers looked at showed comparable impacts on life span.
            </P>
            <P>
The findings come as a follow-up to a study done three years ago, in which a group of distinguished exercise scientists scrutinized data from a large trove of medical and fitness tests conducted at the Cooper Institute in Dallas. That analysis found that as little as five minutes of daily running was associated with prolonged life spans.
                </P>
            <P>

After that study was released, the researchers were inundated with queries from fellow scientists and the general public, says Duck-chul Lee, a professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University and a co-author of the study. Some people asked if other activities, such as walking, were likely to be as beneficial as running for reducing mortality risks.

            <P>
High-mileage runners wondered if they could be doing too much, and if at some undefined number of miles or hours, running might become counterproductive and even contribute to premature mortality,

And a few people questioned whether running really added materially to people’s life spans. Could it be, they asked rather peevishly, that if in order to reduce your risk of dying by a year, you had to spend the equivalent of a year’s worth of time on the trails or track, producing no discernible net gain?
</P>
            <P>
So for the new study, which was published last month in Progress in Cardiovascular Disease, Dr. Lee and his colleagues set out to address those and related issues by reanalyzing data from the Cooper Institute and also examining results from a number of other large-scale recent studies looking into the associations between exercise and mortality.

Over all, this new review reinforced the findings of the earlier research, the scientists determined. Cumulatively, the data indicated that running, whatever someone’s pace or mileage, dropped a person’s risk of premature death by almost 40 percent, a benefit that held true even when the researchers controlled for smoking, drinking and a history of health problems such as hypertension or obesity.

Using those numbers, the scientists then determined that if every nonrunner who had been part of the reviewed studies took up the sport, there would have been 16 percent fewer deaths over all, and 25 percent fewer fatal heart attacks. (One caveat: the participants in those studies were mostly white and middle class.)

Perhaps most interesting, the researchers calculated that, hour for hour, running statistically returns more time to people’s lives than it consumes. Figuring two hours per week of training, since that was the average reported by runners in the Cooper Institute study, the researchers estimated that a typical runner would spend less than six months actually running over the course of almost 40 years, but could expect an increase in life expectancy of 3.2 years, for a net gain of about 2.8 years.</P> </div>

            <P>PADMA LAKSHMI, the model, actress and cookbook author, knows it would be hard to ask for sympathy for her occupational plight.</p> 
            <p>While filming for “Top Chef,” the TV show for which she serves as judge and host, part of her job is to taste food from some of the country’s best chefs every day for five weeks.</p>        
            <p>“That’s tasting 16 to 17 bites of each dish we test, each with 17 to 20 ingredients or more,” she said in an interview. And because the contestants try to make their foods as delicious as possible, “they have a tendency to infuse them with more fat,” she said.</p>        
            <p>Each season, Ms. Lakshmi, 38, keeps two dress sizes on the set for when the weight starts to pile on: she is 5-foot-9 and typically she puts on 10 to 15 pounds a season.</p>
            <P>“I just try to cut myself a break — I know I’m going to gain weight,” she said. “In my job, I eat the most when I’m working the most.”                </P>
            <P>But like other people who work with hard-to-resist food and still manage to stay fit, Ms. Lakshmi has devised a host of strategies, some of which could serve as inspiration and guidance to people whose jobs don’t require them to taste a lot of food.</P>
            <P>The advice comes down to basics: moderate what you eat; don’t panic when work makes you overeat or when you can’t work out; and pay attention to what you are eating.</P>

            <P>“It really comes down to balance — balance in life and balance in food,” said Cynthia Sass, a nutritionist and personal trainer who has worked with the Philadelphia Phillies and the Tampa Bay Rays. “And people who work with food tend to be more aware of their health.”</P>
            <p>Not always. The image of the roly-poly chef is an enduring stereotype, and sometimes for good reason. But portly people are the exception rather than the rule on “Top Chef” and other TV cooking shows.</p>
            <p>While Ms. Lakshmi is famously fit — she recently posed naked for Allure magazine, in a feature about celebrities and body images — it’s all she can do while filming “Top Chef” to get in a workout here or there. She always keeps a jump rope in her suitcase in case she finds herself with free time.</p>
            <p>When the show is not in production, she regularly boxes, walks stairs and does upper body work as part of a daily 90-minute routine. “When the season is over, I go into food detox,” she said, “no red meat, no alcohol, no cheese, until I’m back in shape.”</p>
            <p>For Robert L. Untiedt, who owns Graham’s Fine Chocolates in Geneva, Ill., there is no off-season from dipping and tasting chocolates, though some months seem to pack more calories than others.</p>
            <p>“Around the holidays, when we’re busiest, it can be hard to get away from work,” he said. “Plus there’s all that chocolate.” He tries to fit in a workout three days a week before lunch. He also keeps a bike at the office so he can ride to the post office instead of driving, and he take advantage of his downtown location by walking on errands.That’s at least some compensation for eating about a quarter-pound of chocolate at work every day. He tries to stick to dark chocolate, because it is generally healthier than milk chocolate.</p>
            <p>The combination of regular workouts and staying on his feet most of the day clearly helps. At 6-foot-1 and 175 pounds, Mr. Untiedt’s fit figure doesn’t square with the image many people have in their heads of the owner of a chocolate shop. “They’ll say, surprised: ‘You’re the owner?’ ” he said. “I joke with them that most people just don’t eat enough chocolate because if you do, your body learns to burn it off.”</p>
            <p>But strict regimens like his are hard to maintain, and human frailty often kicks in. Frank Bruni, the restaurant critic for The New York Times, wrote in Men’s Vogue about his quest for a workout regimen that would compensate for the meals he had to eat; he has just written a book about his struggles with eating and bulimia. Meredith Ford Goldman, the food critic for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said she had an eating disorder as a teenager and has had to learn how to keep food in perspective and banish the idea that certain foods are taboo.</p>
            <p>She also made fitness part of her life. Tucked into reviews of restaurants, she regularly mentions her gym and her trainer. “If I really blow it out and eat, like, 4 million calories, guess what? You’ve got to get up and go to the gym,” she said in a telephone interview.</p>
            <p>Working out has never been the challenge for Dan Guerrera, who owns the Downtown Cookie Company in New York City, which delivers and express-mails large, fresh-baked cookies. He makes most of them by hand.</p>
            <p>A former high school and college swimmer, Mr. Guerrera, 38, has been fit all his life and regularly works out six days a week with a group of triathletes. But last year, after a career in finance, he made the full-time career switch into cookies, sometimes putting in 15-hour days surrounded by dough. It took its toll, and he had to adjust his habits.</p>
            <p>Today, “I definitely have a mental notepad in my head: O.K., I’ve had three cookies today,” he said. “The work definitely affects how long I spend on the treadmill.”</p>
            <p>“I just try to find that balance,” he added.</p>

            </figcaption>


            <p>FOR Samwoo Ee, the first bet was just a warm-up. Mr. Ee, 30, worked at an Internet company in SoHo, and had been competing with a colleague to see who could lose more weight. But they had both stopped going to the gym because of long hours at the office. In search of more motivation, they turned up the pressure: they entered into a formal one-month wager to see who could cut the higher percentage of their body mass index.</p>
            <p>“It got pretty competitive,” said Mr. Ee, who weighed 248 at the time. “We used to do push-ups every hour in front of each other’s cubicles. And he used to leave really good chocolate on my desk.” His co-worker, Daniel Fries, won the first month, after losing about 16 pounds to Mr. Ee’s 10, and Mr. Ee paid him $20. Then, Mr. Ee said, “it got serious.”</p>
            <p>Six co-workers joined them in another weight-loss competition. “I told them this was going to be dirty,” Mr. Ee said. There were weekly weigh-ins by an outside record keeper. Mr. Ee finished second in that bet, after losing an additional four pounds. Along the way, Mr. Ee’s officemates enjoyed taunting one another with comments like, “Are you sure you want to eat that bagel?” and “Why don’t you get a cheeseburger for lunch and I’ll get a salad?”</p>
            <p>It was an eight-player example of a diet bet, in which those seeking to lose pounds give themselves a new incentive: money. If they don’t lose more weight than the competition, they lose cash. Internet sites that facilitate diet betting have seen an increase in traffic, and recent studies have supported what Mr. Ee and his co-workers discovered: diet bets work for many people who couldn’t seem to shed pounds any other way.</p>
            <p>“Diet betting is definitely becoming more popular among friends, relatives and co-workers,” said Joy Bauer, author of “Joy’s Life Diet: Four Steps to Thin Forever,” and founder of Joy Bauer Nutrition, a firm with offices in Manhattan and Westchester County. “It makes life easier if everyone around you is cutting calories, and the amicable competition keeps people driven. You are less likely to eat bad things from the candy jar.”</p>
            <p>Most diet bettors agreed that while losing weight was the ultimate goal, winning the bet — and pocketing the winnings — soon became the main reason they stuck to their diets.</p>
            <p>“I wanted to win, and I blew everyone away,” said Christopher Fallon, 36, a medical sales representative from West Orange, N.J. Mr. Fallon participated in a three-month diet bet with nine other colleagues, everyone contributing $100 to a winner-take-all pool. At a sales meeting a few weeks before the end of the bet, Mr. Fallon’s fellow bettors realized that he was way ahead.</p>
            <p>“When I saw Chris at the gym at 6 a.m. looking skeletal, I knew it was over for me,” said one colleague, Carolyn Kramaritsch.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fallon admitted that he enjoyed vanquishing his peers even more than losing the pounds. “I didn’t even need to lose much weight,” he said, “but when I saw everyone else, I thought, ‘I just won $900!’ ”</p>
            <p>A study in the December issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association found that people who had financial incentives to lose weight were much more successful at dieting than those who did not.</p>
            <p>The study created two groups of dieters with financial incentives, as well as a control group. Dr. Kevin Volpp, co-author of the study and an associate professor in behavioral economics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Wharton School, said the prospect of losing or gaining money was a significant incentive for dieters, especially when the money was not rewarded until the end of the period.</p>
            <p>Weekly feedback was also an important component of the study, Dr. Volpp said, as was the very simple fact that people do not like to lose money.</p>
            <p>Similarly, two Yale professors, Dean Karlan and Ian Ayres, studied the effects of commitment contracts on quitting smoking and then applied that research to dieting, developing a business around their theories. They teamed up with a graduate student, Jordan Goldberg, 24, and started StickK.com last year, a Web site that motivates people to make changes in their lives by signing contracts: if they fail in their goals, it costs them money.</p>
            <p>The site has more than 23,000 users, the highest percentage of whom (42 percent) have commitment contracts for losing weight. The site takes credit card information up front and charges your card weekly if you fail to meet your goal. You can designate someone to be your referee — a friend, co-worker or spouse, for example — but in the end, if they fail to do their jobs, then StickK.com takes your word for it.</p>
            <p>Bettors can also designate a friend or charity as recipients of their lost money, but they can also choose a “foe or anti-charity.” As the Web site states, “Wouldn’t it just kill you to hand over your hard-earned money to someone you can’t stand?”</p>
            <p>You can choose from a list, which includes both the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton presidential libraries. The anti-charities have the highest success rate of all the StickK.com bets (85 percent), said Mr. Goldberg, chief executive of the company, adding, “Some people respond better to negative reinforcement.”</p>
            <p>Pablo Juarez, 31, and Paul Sanborn, 40, co-workers at a software company in Washington, made separate diet contracts with StickK.com, designating each other to receive any money they lost. “We decided to bet $1,000 for 40 weeks, at a pound a week,” Mr. Sanborn said. “What drove us to be successful was the money and the social pressure. We have a scale in my office, and our office friends keep track of it.”</p>
            <p>Mr. Juarez said: “I got caught up in the competition. I was cocky at first, but then I missed two weeks.” Both men lost more than 25 pounds.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sanborn says he is particularly motivated to be successful so he can get money from Mr. Juarez that he is already owed. “When we were on a trip to Spain,” Mr. Sanborn said, “I got stuck with a 44-euro bill one night because Pablo was on the dance floor. Now when I’m on the StairMaster, I think, ‘I’m going to get those 44 euros back.’ ”</p>
            <p>TWO other new Web sites, fatbet.net and makemoneylosingweight.com, are designed for dieters who want to challenge one another. The sites, which are free, have formalized the group-diet betting process by providing a forum for publicly tracking weight and setting specific incentives, although neither site handles the monetary part of the bet.</p>
            <p>“Betting makes the approach to weight loss more acceptable for men,” said Prof. Geoffrey Greif of the University of Maryland School of Social Work and author of “Buddy System: Understanding Male Friendships.” “These guys are repeating what they did as kids on the playground to see who can run faster or throw the ball harder. And it’s also a safe way for men to be close.”</p>
            <p>That doesn’t mean women don’t do it. Carol Lewis, 45, who works part time for the Federal Reserve in Boston, made a fat bet last summer with her husband. “He sent an e-mail challenge to me: 12 pounds for him and 6 for me,” Ms. Lewis said. They formalized their bet on fatbet.net and let the games begin.</p>
            <p>The deal was that if Ms. Lewis lost, she had to wear a shirt to their sons’ soccer games that said: “I lost a fat bet to my husband. I am a big loser,” but she had not thought of a wager for him. They both lost some weight, although her husband lost more. Mr. Lewis is now involved in a new bet with other people.</p>
            <p>“We razzed each other a lot,” Ms. Lewis said. “I baked a few cakes to try to tempt him, but he wouldn’t touch them so I ate them myself. But sometimes when I went to get a cookie, he’d look at me, and I’d put it down and say, ‘I’m not going to lose this bet!’ ”</p>

            </figcaption>

            <p>OVER the course of a year, Alex Feintuch, a 20-year-old sophomore at the University of South Carolina, spent more than $1,000 on fitness supplements.</p>
            <p>Mr. Feintuch wanted to add size and definition to his muscles, and to “see results as quickly as possible.” He did research and tried dozens of products, with mixed results.</p>
            <p>“Of the products that I have bought, I’ve found many that work well,” he said. “But some don’t and were a waste of money.”</p>
            <p>The fitness supplements industry is primarily aimed at young men like Mr. Feintuch. Bodybuilding-related products — powders and pills with names like Muscle Milk, Amplified Mass XXX and N.O.-Xplode — represented a $2.7 billion industry in 2008, but one whose benefits are in serious dispute.</p>
            <p>The products are a subset of the more-familiar category of nutritional supplements, which includes mainstream items like vitamin-infused waters and energy bars. That market represented $25 billion in revenue in 2008, according to Nutrition Business Journal, a trade publication.</p>
            <p>Athletes seeking peak performance are often concerned about eating right, choosing foods that allow their bodies to function at their best — everything from bananas to Peak bars. But going the next step to taking a pill or powder elicits more skepticism. Young female athletes, for example, are more apt to stick with multivitamins, energy drinks and bars, doctors and trainers say.</p>
            <p>Male-oriented fitness supplements are not hard to find, but they are hard to figure out. Top-selling products like creatine, whey powder and nitric oxide are widely available under many brand names at drugstores and chains like G.N.C., but they are also minimally regulated, with a majority going untested by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
            <p>And that, sports medicine doctors say, points to the problems: there is little or no uniformity among products, the labels are confusing and the ingredients are arcane. Often, the main active ingredient is simply caffeine.</p>
            <p>“It’s frustrating to not know exactly what I am putting in my body,” said Mr. Feintuch, who used a personal — and expensive — trial-and-error approach to come up with three products that seemed to work for him.</p>
            <p>Doctors and nutritionists say that people who eat a normal diet generally don’t need nutritional supplements, even if they exercise vigorously. But among the subset of people who already eat healthfully and want to bulk up in the gym, some supplements, when taken in sensible doses, can provide a lift.</p>
            <p>For instance, whey protein and creatine, which are meant to add bulk to muscles and raise the body’s ability to lift heavier weights, can, in some cases, help dedicated athletes become stronger faster, doctors and trainers say.</p>
            <p>But the dose recommended on the bottle may be much higher than the dose recommended by doctors. And for this reason and others, doctors emphasize that only adults should take fitness supplements (although high school athletes often do). A policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics advises children under 18 to avoid them.</p>
            <p>“Schools and other sports organizations should be proactive in discouraging the use of performance-enhancing substances,” said Dr. Teri M. McCambridge, who practices pediatric sports medicine in Towson, Md., and is the chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness.</p>
            <p>Dr. McCambridge distinguishes between whey protein, which she considers to be a dietary supplement, and performance-enhancing substances like creatine and nitric oxide. Even so, she said, “the teenage diet already has more than enough protein.”</p>
            <p>“They don’t need the extra amount” that a whey protein powder would provide, she said.</p>
            <p>Further, most high school students “don’t know the importance of a recommended dose,” she said, and “there is a slippery slope when it comes to using other performance-enhancing drugs, like anabolic steroids and human growth hormone.”</p>
            <p><img class="center-block" scr=https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/01/14/fashion/14fitness-1/popup.jpg /></p>
            <p>And taking more than the recommended doses of fitness supplements can be harmful. Too much creatine in the system can lead to stomach upset and muscle cramps, among other things. And most people are familiar with the side effects of too much caffeine.</p>
            <p>Jose Antonio, who edits a magazine called Sports Nutrition Insider and leads a nonprofit group called the International Society for Sports Nutrition, divides the popular supplements into three main categories: amino acid-based products, like whey protein and creatine; caffeine-based stimulants, and healthy fats like omega-3 acids.</p>
            <p>Dr. Antonio is a proponent of several supplements, including whey protein and creatine, but says an athlete’s goals should determine his or her “strategy for use.” Creatine helps add size quickly, so it is good for people who want to bulk up, he said. Whey protein is more of a general fitness supplement and helps hasten the recovery of muscles after a workout, he said.</p>
            <p>Some personal trainers recommend nutritional supplements to their clients. “If you’re looking to bust through a plateau, taking five grams of creatine before your workout might help you do that,” said Steve Hoffman, a trainer in Cherry Hill, N.J. “It adds water weight to your muscle and helps you lift more.”</p>
            <p>For clients who want to intensify their workouts, Mr. Hoffman recommends products with arginine (an amino acid) or caffeine. He has experimented with such products and researched their effects, but he recommends caution for people who have not. “They’re awesome for working out — just be careful,” he said.</p>
            <p>Some athletes avoid such stimulants. Stacey Zimmerman, 25, an advertising account executive and avid runner in New York, consumes protein bars, electrolyte replacement gels but avoids products with creatine and nitric oxide. “I don’t like the idea of taking things when I don’t know how they will affect my body,” she said.</p>
            <p>She has run half-marathons and would one day like to finish a marathon, but without help from a jar. “If my body won’t let me for some reason, then I probably shouldn’t be running it,” she said. “The idea of needing to take a supplement to reach my fitness goals seems to counter the goal itself.”</p>
            <p>On the other side of this issue is Michael Deutsch, a 23-year-old accounting associate from Bethesda , Md., who begins his morning by taking N.O.-Xplode for a pre-workout pump-up. “It definitely gives me energy,” he said. “It is mentally addictive, kind of like caffeine.” (Which it is.)</p>
            <p>Mr. Deutsch then goes to the gym, lifts weights, drinks a whey protein shake, then eats a meal. At the end of his day, he drinks a second whey protein shake.</p>
            <p>He likes the results he sees in the mirror. Before taking supplements, he said, “it was tough to improve at the rate that I wanted to.”</p>
            <p>While Mr. Deutsch swears by nitric oxide and creatine, Mr. Feintuch, who spent $1,000 to refine his supplement regimen, doesn’t take either one. He tried creatine, but didn’t see the bulking effect he wanted. And the nitric oxide product he sampled gave him “nervous jitters instead of energy.”   </p>
            <p>At first, Mr. Feintuch was primarily trying to lose his gut, so he took green tea tablets, which were meant to boost his metabolism. After dropping more than 50 pounds, he graduated to more fitness-oriented products, which he researched through online bodybuilding forums.</p>
            <p>“I looked up each ingredient of supplements and discovered what the effects were, both good and bad,” Mr. Feintuch said. “The final say on a supplement are its ingredients label and the collective reviews of it.”</p>
            <p>Now he has a routine. Before he goes to the gym, he takes a pill called Arimatest meant to raise testosterone levels. “It gives me that edge to push myself harder,” he said. Before, during and after his workout, he drinks a branch-chain amino acid powder mixed in water to hasten muscle recovery. And he caps his gym visits with a whey protein shake.</p>
            <p>Arimatest, which costs $48.99 for 60 tablets on Amazon.com, asserts that it “increases testosterone 10,000 percent.” It is the type of claim that draws skepticism from people like Gunnar Peterson, a celebrity trainer whose clients include Jennifer Lopez and Tom Brady. “Real food is the way to go,” Mr. Peterson said.</p>
            <p>He would like to see the F.D.A. be more active in regulating supplements. “I don’t want people to spend their hard-earned money on bogus products,” Mr. Peterson said.</p>
            <p>But he did say there could be a positive placebo effect to taking fitness supplements. “It allows people to hold onto the magic pill dream,” he said. “It’s like putting jumper cables on motivation.”</p>
             <div class="story-addendum story-content theme-correction"><strong>Correction: January 21, 2010 </strong><P>The Fitness column last Thursday, about nutritional supplements for exercisers, overstated Dr. Teri M. McCambridge’s role at the American Academy of Pediatrics. She is the chairwoman of its council on sports medicine and fitness, not the chairwoman of the entire academy. The article also referred incorrectly to nitric oxide; although caffeine is often added to supplements that contain it, it is not a caffeine-based stimulant. And a picture caption with the article misidentified the exerciser who begins his morning workout by taking N.O.-Xplode. As the article correctly reported, he is Michael Deutsch — not Alex Feintuch, who is shown in the picture.</p>

             <p>AFTER Lynne Wu moved to New York from Cincinnati, she realized her body wasn’t prepared for the sheer amount of pavement-pounding required in her adopted city.</p>
            <p>“At the end of the day my lower back and ankles would hurt,” said Ms. Wu, 40, a development consultant for nonprofit organizations. “I just wasn’t used to walking that much.”</p>
            <p>Ms. Wu discussed her problem with her former yoga teacher in Ohio, who made an unusual suggestion: why not take walking lessons?</p>
            <p>Many people would have been insulted by such advice — don’t we all master this skill as a 1-year-old? — but to Ms. Wu it made perfect sense. “I hate exercising,” she said. “So I thought, ‘What would happen if I could walk properly and get a relaxed, centered workout in a city like this?’ ”</p>
            <p>Last January, Ms. Wu and her husband, Rob Gilson, signed up for private walking classes with Jonathan FitzGordon, a yoga teacher and owner of Yoga Center of Brooklyn.</p>
            <p>During 10 sessions over about seven months, Mr. FitzGordon trained her to walk with her feet parallel, her weight evenly distributed and her body aligned.</p>
            <p>Ten months later, Ms. Wu still had ankle issues — she was in the very late stages of pregnancy — but her back pain was gone and her walk had changed drastically.</p>
            <p>Few of us think we need a course in walking any more than we’d need a course in breathing, but Mr. FitzGordon insists that most Americans don’t have a clue how to step, a problem he first noticed among his yoga students. “People would enter with terrible posture,” he said. “Then they’d do beautiful yoga, and listen to everything I said about alignment. As soon as class ended, they went straight into the bad posture.”</p>
            <p>To help students take their practice into the street, Mr. FitzGordon incorporated walking lessons into his yoga classes, as well as teaching small group and individual sessions. His clients are mostly people who have visited doctors, chiropractors and massage therapists in search of relief for muscle or joint pain.</p>
            <p>Under Mr. FitzGordon’s instruction, the clients try to correct their entire movement system rather than address aching knees or shoulders in isolation. “The body is like a machine,” he said. “Each part has it’s own job, and everything is connected.”</p>
            <p>But unlike a car, the body also has the ability to compensate if one part breaks. “If you get a flat tire, you’re not going anywhere,” Mr. FitzGordon said. “But if you hurt your foot, you can limp and keep going.” Thus, the entire machine is thrown out of whack.</p>
            <p>Dr. Keith Kolber, a neonatologist in Los Angeles who was suffering from a herniated disc, was hoping to avoid surgery when he booked several private walking lessons with Sherry Brourman, a yoga instructor and physical therapist. As Ms. Brourman watched him walk barefoot and shirtless through her studio, she noticed that he was leaning away from the pain. Ms. Brourman helped him regain proper alignment, with his weight falling on all four corners of his feet.</p>
            <p>“Over time my gait looked more natural, and it became more easy and more curative,” said Dr. Kolber, 46. “If I felt my back was acting up, I’d go for a mile or two walk, and I’d feel better at the end because I was making the right corrections.”</p>
            <p>Ms. Brourman said most postural problems happen when the body’s muscles don’t perform their intended job. For example, people who don’t use their stomach muscles when they walk cause strain by forcing the back muscles to compensate.</p>
            <p>The proper move is to make subtle realignments in the rest of the body, like pushing the inner thighs back and untucking the tailbone. Such adjustments may seem minor, but Ms. Brourman admits that not everyone likes being told how to walk.</p>
            <p>“It hits them where it hurts,” said Ms. Brourman, who is also an author of “Walk Yourself Well” (Hyperion, 1999). “People want to feel like they know how to do this.”</p>
            <p>Dr. Steven Haddad, an orthopedic surgeon with the Illinois Bone and Joint Institute in Chicago, said exercise could help relieve certain soft-tissue problems, but warned that it could not correct a bone misalignment or deformity.</p>
            <p>“You can’t make your bones go in different direction than they want to go in,” he said.</p>
            <p>FORCING the body to move against its natural patterns and bone structure could even lead to deeper problems, said Dr. Susan Lewis, associate director of Women’s Sports Medicine at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco.</p>
            <p>“If you’re pushing yourself in a place that isn’t comfortable, I’d respect that,” she said. But both doctors agreed that if the focus was on strengthening the trunk, centering your weight and breaking bad habits like slouching, movement lessons could be helpful.</p>
            <p>Of course, learning to walk properly is one thing. Breaking a 30- or 40-year habit is quite another.</p>
            <p>Dr. Heidi Prather, associate professor of orthopedic surgery at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said people with strong yoga practices who sign up for eight or more sessions will be somewhat self-selecting in their ability to maintain, but such discipline is rare in the general population.</p>
            <p>“Sometimes I’ll tell patients that their issues are more cerebral than physical — they need to think about how they move,” she said. “Most people don’t want to do that. They want a quick fix.”</p>
            <p>Two years after taking Mr. FitzGordon’s program, Sharon Goldman said she couldn’t go back to her old walk if she tried. Ms. Goldman, 39, injured herself during a midlife crisis; a painful divorce compelled her to throw herself into numerous physical activities — running, in-line skating, tennis — that her body wasn’t prepared for.</p>
            <p>For more than a year, she visited a number of doctors and physical therapists to treat the pain that ran from her legs to her neck, but she didn’t experience long-term relief until she started working with Mr. FitzGordon — in part because he spoke in plain, everyday language.</p>
            <p>“They were saying essentially the same things, but the physical therapist would say, ‘You need to get a sense of where you are in space,’ ” said Ms Goldman, the executive editor of a marketing trade magazine. “Jonathan would say, ‘Don’t tuck your tailbone.’ ”</p>
            <p>Ms. Goldman does not think changing her gait alone prompted her recovery. She also credited intensive physical therapy, as well as yoga and Pilates, but learning to walk was the first step.</p>

        </h4>
      </div>
      <div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
             <p>AS much as an American visitor may try to maintain his suave demeanor while strolling the periphery of the Place Vendôme, it is almost impossible not to stop and gawk at the windows of the stores selling men's clothing. "Who can fit into these things?" is what comes to mind when a visitor beholds the showily attired mannequins, with their pipestem arms and pigeon breasts.</p>
            <p>Obviously, the only candidate is a fashionable Frenchman, with his trademark wispy frame. So how will this coexist with a new trend toward more muscular physiques? In France these days, fitness is in, or to put it another way, c'est bon to be buff.</p>
            <p>However odd it strikes some of their countrymen, a growing number of Frenchmen are climbing StairMasters and doing forced marches along treadmills to preserve themselves "en bonne forme."</p>
            <p>Others are doing tummy crunches to develop that coveted state of abdominal musculature known as "la tablette de chocolat" -- the French equivalent of "six-pack abs."</p>
            <p>Here, too, in the city where Camus and Sartre pondered existentialism while wreathed in acrid tobacco fumes, where Proust produced novels without leaving his bed, they are even -- gasp -- pumping iron.</p>
            <p>"This is a big change in France," said Jean François Chesneau, a personal trainer at the Fitness First health club, on the Rue Lafontaine in the upscale 16th Arrondissement. "Fifteen years ago, nobody did fitness. It was not the habitude. Now, people are doing every kind of training."</p>
            <p>On a May afternoon at Fitness First, many clients indicated that "le workout" has been a revelation. A retired French police officer who identified himself only as Gilbert took a break from a shoulder muscle machine to announce that after only three months of such exercise, he had lost five kilos, about 11 pounds.</p>
            <p>Robert Benaim, a marketing executive in Paris, said he has been working out on the club's "musculation" machines for three years. "It's a tonic," he said. "It helps me remain supple. And my wife is very happy that I am doing it."</p>
            <p>Of course, this being France, people take a uniquely French approach to fitness. "The French are fundamentally different from Americans and Englishmen," said Daniel Chaffey, a native of England who is a manager for the Fitness First chain of health clubs. "The French idea of fitness is 'bien etre' -- feeling good. As long as they can say, 'I feel fine,' then they think everything's O.K."</p>
            <p>"They don't understand that Anglo-Saxon idea of 'no pain, no gain,' " he said.</p>
            <p>But then, asking a Frenchman to sweat has traditionally been like asking a cat to swim; though it can, it is not inclined to.</p>
            <p>"Exercise is not in our nature," said Pierre Chevalier, a business executive in Paris who on a recent morning was about as close to exercise as he cares to get -- enjoying his morning coffee at the Hotel Meurice while watching the joggers in the Tuileries Gardens across the street.</p>
            <p>"We are not a nation of effort," Mr. Chevalier said. "After all, if you have savoir-faire, you do things effortlessly. Now we are told that it is good to exercise, to make the effort. Fine. So in my cellar, I have my treadmill, my musculation machine, but I don't use them. I took a personal trainer, and I bought all the sports clothes and special shoes and I went out and ran through the Tuileries. But now, the first reason I have to not go, I use it. It is raining, or it might rain. Or I have an appointment. Or I should make an appointment."</p>
            <p>Even so, Mr. Chevalier said he considers himself more sporting than the average Frenchman. "I take three weeks off every year and go fly fishing in Scotland and every winter I take my children skiing. But then, what is the essence of skiing?"</p>
            <p>He answered his own question. "Effortlessness."</p>
            <p>Apart from their distaste for obvious effort, French sophisticates have long been puzzled by the American affinity for muscularity. "That weight lifter look has never been popular in France," said Therese Casadesus Rawson, who spent her formative years in France and now divides her time between homes on the Philadelphia Main Line and Paris. "Muscles were the sign of the laborer."</p>
            <p>Be that as it may, the number of health clubs in France has grown significantly. There are more than 3,500 commercial health clubs in France today, compared with about 2,500 two years ago, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, an industry group based in Boston. Of course, that is far less than the 23,500 commercial health clubs in the United States today, according to the association.</p>
            <p>Some Francophiles argue that the relative paucity of gyms in France testifies to a more enlightened lifestyle. "They ski. They play soccer. They walk or bicycle instead of driving two blocks the way Americans do," said Karen Fawcett, editor of BonjourParis.com, a Web site that offers travel tips and insights from the expatriate community. "That's why they don't need to work out at a gym."</p>
            <p>Others point out that the increase represents a real accomplishment in France, where strict labor laws and the tax structure make it difficult to operate businesses like health clubs, which must stay open nights and weekends.</p>
            <p>Indeed, said Fred Hoffman, a consultant to Reebok who has created fitness programs in some 45 countries over the last two decades, "many of the big fitness chains shy away from France. It's the black sheep of the European fitness industry."</p>
            <p>As it happens, the founder of the modern Olympics was a Frenchman, the educational philosopher Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Even he had to admit that for many of his countrymen, sporting activity was an uphill battle.</p>
            <p>As he wrote in 1896, around the time of the first games, "In France, physical inertia was considered the necessary corollary for mental development. It was accepted that sporting activity would anyhow be injurious to study and as for the formation of character there did not even exist a notion that there could be a link between body and volition."</p>
            <p>That was the opposite of the thinking that prevailed at the time in England, where the wealthy were (and still are) famous for packing off their male offspring to boarding schools to bash heads playing rugby with their well-born schoolmates. As the Duke of Wellington opined in 1815, "The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton."</p>
            <p>Many would argue that the whole point of sports is not wealth or status but, rather, those all-American virtues of school spirit, sacrifice and teamwork. The French tend not to see it that way. "Teamwork?" said Mr. Chevalier, from his front-row seat at the Hotel Meurice. "We don't have teamwork in France. Every Frenchman is unique and exclusive."</p>
            <p>Or, as Charles de Gaulle put it, "How can you run a country with more than 264 kinds of cheese?"</p>
            <p>Indeed, where else but in France would a health club brochure start with a quote from Jean-Paul Sartre: "L'enfer, c'est les autres," which translates to "Hell is other people." So begins the brochure for the Ken Club, which is just a short stroll from Fitness First but a world apart in its atmosphere.</p>
            <p>"We are a very exclusive club," the manager, Arthur Benzaquen, said, leading the way down a corridor where the minimalist gray was relieved by shoots of bamboo, all very subdued and Zen-like. The Ken Club reflects the French fitness trend, having opened as a spa in 1985 before being retrofitted as a health club in 2002.</p>
            <p>Mr. Benzaquen admits that at 2,500 euros (about $3,000) a year for a basic membership, the Ken Club isn't cheap.</p>
            <p>But then, it is not intended for everyone. "We offer true bien etre," he said. "Unlike other clubs, it is no sacrifice to come here. If you are too tired after work to do sport, you can come here and just relax in the swimming pool. Or get a massage or tan. You can even come here and just sleep. But it's better than going home, and you know why, don't you?" An uncomfortable moment of silence follows before Mr. Benzaquen continues, "Because here, we are a gym."</p>
            <p>It is hard to say what will happen to the fitness industry in the face of the findings presented at the 11th European Congress on Obesity in Vienna. According to European studies involving some 8,800 middle-aged men, walking or cycling to work can be just as effective as more intense workouts. Moreover, one expert said, less strenuous workouts are far easier to promote to the public.</p>
            <p>The researchers who conducted this study were, of course, French.</p>
